# Air Quality Data Visualization

This project presents an interactive **Tableau dashboard** for analyzing **air quality** across various states and cities in India. The visualization explores different **pollutants**, trends over time, and geographic variations in air quality indices.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)** by state and city
- **Pollutant levels** (SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM) over time
- **Comparative analysis** of air pollution across different regions
- **Monthly and yearly trends** in air quality data

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features

- **Choropleth maps** displaying AQI by **state** and **city**.
- **Bar charts** showing pollutant levels (SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM) across states.
- **Line graphs** illustrating trends in pollution over **years and months**.
- **Comparative analysis** of PM2.5 levels across different states.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository

- `DV Final project Sujith.twbx` - Tableau workbook containing the visualization.
- `Data_2.csv`, `Data_3.csv`, `Summers.csv` - Data files used for analysis.
- `Screenshot.png` - Snapshot of the dashboard.
- `README.md` - Project description and instructions.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tableau** for data visualization
- **Python & Pandas** (for data preprocessing, if applicable)
- **OpenStreetMap** for geographic visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Source

The data used in this project includes air pollution records, pollutant levels, and AQI information. The sources might include:
- Government air quality monitoring agencies
- Open-source environmental datasets

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Open the `DV Final project Sujith.twbx` file in **Tableau**.
2. Explore the different dashboards for insights.
3. Modify the filters to analyze specific timeframes or locations.
